// 1. Write a program to check whether the given input number is
// divisible by 3 or else show a message “Number is not divisible
// by 3”.



// 2. Write a program that checks whether the given input is an even
// number or an odd number.



// 3. Write an if/else statement with the following condition:
// If the variable age is greater than 18, output "Old enough",
// otherwise output "Too young".



// 4. Write a program that prompts the user for their name, and then
// displays a special greeting to that person if their name is the
// same as yours. If the name entered by the user is anything
// other than your name, your code should not produce any
// output.



// 5. Write a program to check whether the given input number is
// divisible by 3 or not by using Switch Case statements. Show a
// message “Number is not divisible by 3” or “Number is divisible
// by 3”.
// 6. Write a program that takes a character(number or string) in a
// variable & checks whether the given input is a number,
// uppercase letter or lower case letter. (Hint: ASCII codes:-
// A=65, Z=90, a=97, z=122)



// 7. Write a program to create a calculator for +, -, *, /, % using
// switch case statements. (number1, number2 and operator will
// be input)



// 8. Write a program that takes time as input from user in 24 hours
// clock format like: 1900 = 7pm. Implement the following case
// using if, else & else if statements



// 9. Write a program that takes a calendar year in YYYY format in
// a variable. Check & notify the user whether it is a leap year or
// not.



// 10. Write a program that
// a. Store correct password in a JS variable.
// b. Asks user to enter his/her password
// c. Validate the two passwords:
// i. Check if user has entered password. If not, then give
// message “ Please enter your password”
// ii. Check if both passwords are same. If they are same,
// show message “Correct! The password you entered
// matches the original password”. Show “Incorrect
// password” otherwise.



// 11. Write a program that adds an else statement to the following
// script to display “You are not Fahad”
// var firstName = "Ali";
// if (firstName === "Fahad") {
// document.write("Hello Fahad!");
// }



// 12. This if/else statement does not work. Try to fix it:
// var greeting;
// var hour = 13;
// if (hour < 18) {
// greeting = "Good day";
// else
// greeting = "Good evening";
// }



// 13. Write a JavaScript program that accept two integers and
// display the larger. Also show if the two integers are equal.



// 14. Write a program that takes input a number from user & state
// whether the number is positive, negative or zero.



// 15. Ask the user what the current hour is. If the hour is between
// 6 and 9 a.m., tell the user, "Breakfast is served." If the hour is
// between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., tell the user, "Time for lunch." If
// the hour is between 5 and 8 p.m., tell the user, "It's dinner
// time." For any other hours, tell the user, "Sorry, you'll have to
// wait, or go get a snack." (Hint: Store the hour in 24 hours clock
// format i.e. 14 for 2pm , 15 for 3pm)
// 16. Write a program that stores value in a variable & tell whether
// the type of that variable is a "number", "string", "boolean" or
// “undefined”



// 17. Write a program that takes a character (i.e. string of length 1)
// and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.



// 18. Choose the correct comparison operator to display "true",
// when:
// 10 is NOT equal to 8.
// 19. Use a switch statement to rewrite the following JavaScript
// code. Prompt the user for the number of a month rather than
// setting it to 8:



// 20. Use a conditional (ternary) operator for this exercise:
// If the variable age is a value below 18, the value of the variable
// voteable should be "Too young",
// otherwise the value of voteable should be "Old enough".
